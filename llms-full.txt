# Human4AI Full Documentation

> Human4AI bridges human perception with AI agents for seamless collaborative intelligence.  
> We provide a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to request human input, judgment, and perception in real time.  
> Our mission: **Make something AI needs** — bring human judgment into AI workflows at scale.

## Introduction

Human4AI is a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) service** that plugs directly into AI agents using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
AI agents can use our MCP server to request human support when they encounter limitations or tasks requiring human perception.  

This includes:
- **Overcoming alignment restrictions**: e.g., Captcha solving, subjective moderation.  
- **Providing human judgment**: nuanced decisions, cultural context, ethical reasoning.  
- **Verification tasks**: screenshot validation, UI correctness, code reviews.  

By treating humans as first-class MCP tools, Human4AI creates a **collaborative intelligence network** where AI agents and humans solve tasks together.

## Getting Started

### Quickstart
1. Connect your AI agent to:  
   ```
   https://human4.ai/mcp
   ```  
2. Authenticate with OAuth2 (see below).  
3. Discover available MCP tools automatically via `list_tools`.  
4. Call tools like `ask_human`, `solve_captcha`, or `verify_ui`.  

Note: You can use https://human4.ai/mcp/playground to test and verify the MCP Server capabilities.

### Authentication
- OAuth2-based login.  
- Obtain client ID/secret from Human4AI dashboard.  
- Exchange for tokens at:  
  ```
  https://human4.ai/auth/realms/human4-ai/oauth/token
  ```  
- Pass as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in requests.

## Capabilities (MCP Tools)

- **ask_human(question: string)** – Ask a human a free-text question.  
- **solve_captcha(image: base64)** – Human solves Captcha challenges.  
- **verify_ui(screenshot: base64, instructions: string)** – Human validates UI screenshots against instructions.  
- **judgment(context: string, options: [string])** – Human selects among multiple options.  
- **code_review(diff: string, description: string)** – Human reviews code diffs with context.  
- **custom_task(description: string)** – Flexible custom tasks for human operators.

## Example Workflows

### Captcha Solving
**Request:**
```json
{
  "method": "call_tool",
  "params": {
    "name": "solve_captcha",
    "arguments": { "image": "<base64>" }
  }
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{ "result": "x7b9q" }
```

### UI Validation
**Request:**
```json
{
  "method": "call_tool",
  "params": {
    "name": "verify_ui",
    "arguments": {
      "screenshot": "<base64>",
      "instructions": "Check if the page has a green 'Submit' button"
    }
  }
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{ "verified": true, "comment": "The button exists and is green." }
```

## Use Cases

- **Captcha Solving**: Humans handle restricted alignment tasks.  
- **UI Validation**: Humans verify screenshots and design flows.  
- **Subjective Judgment**: Human reasoning for nuanced decisions.  
- **Code Review**: Human engineers review software trade-offs.  
- **Fallback**: AI agents call humans when uncertain.  

---

## Developer Resources

- **API Reference**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over MCP, HTTP transport.  
- **SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Rust.  
- **Examples**: Integration samples at GitHub `Human4AI/examples`.  
- **Infra**: Nx monorepo, Argo CD GitOps, Kubernetes orchestration.

## Security & Privacy

- Fair Work: Humans are ethically compensated.  
- Privacy: Only context needed for the task is shared.  
- Data Security: TLS encryption, anonymized operator responses.  
- Auditability: Logs and replay available with consent.  

---

## Philosophy

We believe that **privacy and intelligence are inseparable**.  
Human4AI resists centralization of intelligence by giving humans control in AI workflows.  
Humans are first-class agents in our ecosystem.
