# Human4AI

> Human4AI bridges human perception with AI agents for seamless collaborative intelligence.  
> Our mission: **Make something AI needs** — bring human judgment into AI workflows at scale.

## Introduction
Human4AI is a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) service delivered through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
AI agents can use our MCP server to request human input, verification, or subjective judgment in real time.  
This helps agents overcome limitations like alignment restrictions, lack of real-world perception, or the need for nuanced human decisions.  

By connecting to our MCP server, any AI agent gains access to **Human Expertise as a Service**:  
- Ask humans questions.  
- Delegate Captcha solving.  
- Request UI validation.  
- Get code reviews and design trade-offs.  
- Involve humans in subjective or ambiguous tasks.
